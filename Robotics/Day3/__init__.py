Lab3 - Tkinter

Students are given the starter code. They need to implement following GUI components:
. A square representing hamster
. Hamster joystick. Bind keyboard buttons(w,a,s,d,x) to robot movements, x for exit.
. Display line segment for proximity sensor reading. Length of line segment is proportional to the distance of object detected.
. Display floor sensors readings using the two small rectangles on square 'hamster'.

Blind Test:
. When the students finish the above. They need to use their program
 to drive hamster out of a maze set up by TAs.

Maze solver
. Harder maze set up by TAs

Getting ready for Grid navigation!
. Use two sensors to follow Grid
. Detect and acknowledge insection by making some sound
. Rotate hamster about its center 90 degrees, left and right
