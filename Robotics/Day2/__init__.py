Lab2 - Closed loop control

Assignments(line follower must be able to follow line patterns we provide)

 - Play with Bang-bang controller we provide, understand the logic, how sensor readings are
 	used by the controller. Understand the limitation of the algorithm.

 - Students use the starter code we provide to implement 3-position controller using 2 sensors

 - Students use the starter code we provide to implement a p-controller using 1 sensor

 - Implement 2-sensor PID controller to make >= 90degree turns (stretch)

 - After line follower is completed and tested, implement hallway following (stretch)

 - After hallway following is completed, implement a maze solver. (stretch)
 

'''
 There are lot of control specific exercises students can do for this lab.
 - Read different sensors to understand the dynamic range of raw data.
 - What is the scale factor to balance two wheels so the robot can move along
 	a straight line(almost straight) without sensors?
 - what is the correlation between wheel power level and angular velocity of wheel?
 - How to rotate robot about a given rotation center? Forward kinematics of differential drive system.
 - How is robot's speed related to the wheel power level?
 - How to spin robot a given angle
