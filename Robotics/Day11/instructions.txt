Lab11 - Local avoidance using Artificial Potential Field method.

Starter program: tk_robot_simulator_localavoidance_APF.py.


How your program is tested:
Once a goal location is specified, select to run the program in "Real Robot" mode.


Assignment: 
There is a method, avoidance(), in ThreadedClient class. It is a simple avoidance program. 
It does not know about the goal. Reimplement this method by using APF method as described below.

A given goal imposes an "attractive force" on the robot. While in "Real Robot" mode, 
your program can use the robot proximity sensor input to detect the "repulsive force". 
Your program controls Hamster motion by taking into account of both forces and moves robot towards the user
specified goal while avoiding obstacles.
