Lab10 - Re-plan and local avoidance

Assignments:
. PRIORITY: Re-plan in grid space, assuming the following grid navigation components are finished:
	1. generate graph from given grid dimension and obstacle locations
	2. search graph and find a path from any given start and goal
	3. hamster executes plan on grid

. STRETCH: Implement obstacle avoidance using APF, artificial potential field. Adjust direction of movement using proximity sensors.


  . Re-plan requirements: (if you have time)
  	a) Hamster detects new obstacle while executing a plan. Re-plan program needs to add
  	  the new obstacle to obstacle list, generate a new graph. Hamster current
  	  pose is the new start pose.
	b) Re-plan program searches for a path for a new start and same prior goal
	c) execute plan
	d) Re-plan program should be able to repeat the above, i.e. dealing with more
	  unexpected obstacles until goal is reached.

. Work on algorithms for continuous space planning. (optional)
. Implement algorithms for continuous space planning. (optional)
